# Car Price Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the selling price of used cars based on various features such as fuel type, seller type, transmission type, and more. Using a Linear Regression model, the project helps in estimating the market value of cars, assisting both sellers and buyers in making informed decisions.

## Dataset
- **Name:** `car_data.csv`
- **Description:** The dataset includes features such as car name, year, selling price, present price, kilometers driven, fuel type, seller type, transmission type, and owner type.
- **Source:** Ensure that the dataset is included in your repository or provide instructions on how to obtain it.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/car-price-prediction.git
   cd car-price-prediction
   ```
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   - Create a `requirements.txt` file that includes the following:
     ```
     pandas
     matplotlib
     seaborn
     scikit-learn
     ```

## Usage
1. Ensure the dataset (`car_data.csv`) is in the project directory.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook car_price_prediction.ipynb
   ```
3. Follow the steps in the notebook to load the data, preprocess it, train the model, and evaluate the results.

### Script Usage
Alternatively, you can execute the project as a Python script:
   ```bash
   python car_price_prediction.py
   ```

## Model Explanation
- **Linear Regression:** A statistical method used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (selling price) and one or more independent variables (features like fuel type, transmission type, etc.).
- **Feature Encoding:** Categorical features such as `Fuel_Type`, `Seller_Type`, and `Transmission` are encoded as numerical values to be used in the regression model.

## Results
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE):** The MAE is computed to evaluate the model's prediction accuracy.
- **Visualization:** A scatter plot of actual vs. predicted car prices is generated to visualize how closely the model's predictions align with the actual values.

## Applications
- **Predict Selling Price:** Helps in predicting the selling price of cars based on their attributes.
- **Informed Decision-Making:** Assists car buyers and sellers in making informed pricing decisions.
